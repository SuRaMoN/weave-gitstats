Weave based git statistics
==========================

Most git statistics generators have little or no control about the
data being generated. No drill downs in graphs, no filters, just
some default stats and graphs. This tool uses the power of
[weave](http://iweave.com) to visualize all you precious data.

Run with docker
===============

Docker FTW!

    docker run -p 8080:80 -e GIT_URL="https://github.com/symfony/yaml.git" -it suramon/weave-gitstats

Replace the GIT_URL variable with the git repo url you want to
take statistics from.
The statistics will be available on
[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

How it works
============
It uses a simple PHP script to parse the git log output and save
it to a MySQL database (configurable in config.ini). Weave is purely
web based (it has some server side backend code but we don't use it).
We feed the data to weave through an ajax call that passes a SQL query.

This combines the power of SQL with the power of weave!

Tweak it
========
Sometimes your statistics look crooked because:

 * Authors use different names
 * Huge test files or are committed that don't count as code
 * Autogenerated code is committed
 * Files that should be ignored are added and later removed

To counter this you can create a view that filers these files/commits.
Goto [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) click on adminer
and edit the view files_committed_clean. Eg:

    CREATE VIEW files_committed_clean AS SELECT * FROM files_committed WHERE file NOT LIKE '%.xml'

This will filter all the xml file commits in your project. you can also
filter on hash, or rewrite some authors names.
